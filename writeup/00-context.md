## TLDR

I bought a robot to understand the state of the art of camera motion control before designing my own
First I transported the robot to my shop and built a base
Next I stabilized the decades old hardware by emulating a SCSI drive with an SD card
Finally I implemented a modern ergonomic browser based programming system

## Inspiration

Around 3 years ago there was a spurt of youtubers creating various camera stabilization

This inspired me to design and print a mechanical stabilization platform

And if I was going to make a robot arm, why not motorize it?

And if I'm going to create a robot arm... I should understand the state of the art!

Thus inspired my desire to own an industrial robot.
